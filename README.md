Scripts Associated with Heterochiasmy Analyses in Threespine Stickleback Fish

# Project Design

I performed ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on paired samples on threespine stickleback individuals from Lake Washington (both males and females). I collected liver and gonads (ovaries or testes) from each sample where half the liver and one gonad were used for ATAC-seq and the other half of the liver and the other gonad were used for RNA-seq.
