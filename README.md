Scripts Associated with Heterochiasmy Analyses in Threespine Stickleback Fish

# Project Design

I did ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on paired samples for two different populations of threespine stickleback fish (Pacific Ocean, a marine population, and Lake Washington, a freshwater population) in both males and females. I collected liver and gonads (ovaries or testes) from each sample where half the liver and one gonad were used for ATAC-seq and the other half of the liver and the other gonad were used for RNA-seq.

The scripts for calling peaks for ATAC-seq samples and the general pipeline for RNA-seq alignment to differential expression are in separate repositories (maybe, I might change my mind on this).
